# A simple study of 2022 traffic accidents in France (Ongoing, beginning of the project)

This personal project aims to analyze and model the traffic accidents in France, try to get insights from them. 
The core of the study is located in the eda.ipynb file and consists of an exploratory data analysis for all datasets provided (by gender, serverity, geographical, types of vehicle,...) and some machine learning techniques such as clustering, time series analysis, PCA and regressions. 

The dbscan notebook aims to find clusters in France where accidents are frequent and draws the clusters using folium, which generates a HTML file. Due to some limitations, it is not possible to plot the map directly using GitHub. 

The datasets are available in the data/ folder and get from the [Ministère de l'Intérieur](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/bases-de-donnees-annuelles-des-accidents-corporels-de-la-circulation-routiere-annees-de-2005-a-2022/) website. 

There is also another pdf file that comes along these datasets, which explains every kind of variables.
